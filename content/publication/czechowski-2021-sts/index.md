abstract: 'Planning in large state spaces inevitably needs to balance the depth and
  breadth of the search. It has a crucial impact on the performance of a planner and
  most manage this interplay implicitly. We present a novel method Shoot Tree Search
  (STS), which makes it possible to control this trade-off more explicitly. Our algorithm
  can be understood as an interpolation between two celebrated search mechanisms:
  MCTS and random shooting. It also lets the user control the bias-variance trade-off,
  akin to TD(n), but in the tree search context.'
