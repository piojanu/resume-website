abstract: Complex sequential data in decision-making problems pose a challenge for
  AI solutions. Most state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, although
  actively studied in hope of a solution to this challenge, use the naive action space
  noise for exploration which limps in practical situations where state-action space
  becomes huge. We propose a novel auto-curriculum mechanism that divides a problem
  into smaller sub-problems and let an agent learn from them. This allows us to successfully
  teach the agent to play football in simulation. Our algorithm takes a step on a
  path to automatic stock trading, chip design, human-level AI in modern games, and
  more.
