title: 'Bayesian Neural Networks - Implementing, Training, Inference With the JAX Framework'
summary: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) are different from Artificial Neural Networks (NN). The main difference - BNNs can respond “I’m not sure”. Which is interesting, but why would you want a neural network to tell you that it doesn’t know the answer to your question?
