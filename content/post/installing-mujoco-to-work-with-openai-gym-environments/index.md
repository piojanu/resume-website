title: 'Installing MuJoCo to Work With OpenAI Gym Environments'
summary: In this article, I’ll show you how to install MuJoCo on your Mac/Linux machine in order to run continuous control environments from OpenAI’s Gym. These environments include classic ones like HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker, Ant, and Humanoid and harder ones like object manipulation with a robotic arm or robotic hand dexterity. I’ll also discuss additional agent diagnostics provided by the environments that you might not have considered before.
