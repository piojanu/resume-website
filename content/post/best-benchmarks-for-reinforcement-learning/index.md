title: 'Best Benchmarks for Reinforcement Learning: The Ultimate List'
summary: In this post, I’ll share with you my library of environments that support training reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The basis for RL research, or even playing with or learning RL, is the environment. It’s where you run your algorithm to evaluate how good it is. We’re going to explore 23 different benchmarks, so I guarantee you’ll find something interesting!
